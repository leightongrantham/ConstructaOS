Style requirements:
- Black ink on white background
- Inspired by Neave Brown's architectural drawing style
- Thin, consistent line weights throughout
- Minimal shading, if any
- Clean, precise technical drawing aesthetic

Content requirements:
- Single building mass only
- No people, trees, vegetation, or landscape elements
- No text, labels, annotations, or lettering
- Focus purely on the architectural form and structure

The drawing should be a technical axonometric projection showing the building's form, structure, and spatial relationships from an elevated angle that reveals multiple faces simultaneously.`;
