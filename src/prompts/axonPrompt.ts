export const AXON_PROMPT_V1 = `Ultra high-resolution 2.5D axonometric architectural line drawing. Use isometric/axonometric projection with shallow depth, parallel verticals, and no perspective convergence.

CRITICAL PROJECTION REQUIREMENTS (takes precedence over all stylistic instructions):
- 2.5D axonometric projection - mandatory, non-negotiable
- Shallow depth - keep depth dimension restrained
- Parallel verticals - all vertical lines must remain parallel
- No perspective convergence - maintain isometric/axonometric parallel projection throughout

Style: Neave Brown architectural drawing aesthetic. Clean, precise black ink linework with subtle grayscale hatching for material textures. Modernist, rectilinear, and modular design. The drawing should feel professional, like an architectural axonometric presentation.`;
