STYLE REQUIREMENTS (NEAVE BROWN - SAME AS AXONOMETRIC):
- Neave Brown–inspired architectural language
- Clean, precise black ink linework with subtle grayscale hatching for depth and material texture
- Thin, consistent black linework
- Off-white paper background (not pure white)
- Subtle tonal variation only
- Human-scale proportions
- Can use slightly thicker lines for cut elements (standard architectural convention)
- Can include minimal line-drawn figures for scale (standing) - appropriate for cutaway view
- Can include simple ground/landscape context (minimalist grayscale rendering) if helpful for understanding
- Calm, neutral presentation suitable for early design discussion
- No cars, furniture, text, labels, annotations, or technical symbols

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus on building structure: walls, floors, roofs, structural elements, openings
- Single building section cutaway, avoid multiple buildings
- Can include minimal ground line/context if helpful for understanding vertical relationships
- Can include minimal line-drawn figures for scale (standing) - appropriate for cutaway view
- Avoid detailed furniture, fixtures, or interior objects
- Avoid text, labels, annotations, dimensions, or lettering
- Avoid grid lines, scale bars, or reference elements

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Projection type: Isometric/axonometric cutaway view - angled view showing interior space
- View angle: Angled to reveal interior spatial relationships
- Line rendering: Clean, precise linework with subtle grayscale hatching
- Cut representation: Elements cut by section plane can be shown with slightly thicker lines (standard convention)
- Composition: Section cutaway as architectural presentation - calm, balanced, quietly aspirational

OUTPUT: A clean architectural concept isometric/axonometric section cutaway in Neave Brown style. Angled cutaway view showing floor plates, walls, and roof profile. Can include simple ground context and minimal figures for scale. No labels or dimensions.`;
